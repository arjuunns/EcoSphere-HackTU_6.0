# ♻️ Waste Analytics Dashboard  

A smart IOT based waste management dashboard for monitoring urban waste trends, optimizing collection schedules, and promoting sustainability.

---

## ❌ Problem Statement  

Urban areas generate **massive amounts of waste** daily, leading to:  
- Overflowing garbage bins causing **health hazards and pollution**.  
- Inefficient **waste collection schedules**, increasing operational costs.  
- Lack of **public awareness and participation** in waste management.  
- This results in increased pollution, health hazards, and a growing carbon footprint.

## ✅ Our Solution  

### 🌱 **Smart Waste Analytics Dashboard**  
A **real-time monitoring system** that:  
✔️ **Tracks fill levels** of waste bins dynamically.  
✔️ **Predicts optimal collection times** to improve efficiency.  
✔️ **Identifies high-waste areas** using a **heatmap**.  
✔️ **Encourages recycling & waste reduction** through the **Green Heroes feature**.

## 🚀 Features  

### 📊 **Real-Time Waste Analytics**  
- **Dynamic Fill Percentage:** Tracks waste levels in bins across different areas.  
- **Recyclable vs. Non-Recyclable Waste:** Pie chart representation.  
- **Waste Contribution by Area:** Bar chart displaying the percentage of waste generated in different locations.  

### 🔥 **Heatmap for High-Waste Areas**  
- Visual representation of waste distribution in different regions.  
- Identifies hotspots for **overflowing bins** and inefficient collection points.  

### 🏆 **Green Heroes Recognition**  
- Highlights **individuals or organizations** actively contributing to waste reduction.  
- Encourages community participation in sustainable waste management.  

### ⏳ **Waste Collection Optimization**  
- **Optimal Collection Timing:** Scatter chart predicting the best times for garbage collection.  
- **Average Time to Full Capacity:** Tracks the speed at which bins reach full capacity.  

### 📍 **Chandni Chowk Dynamic Data**  
- **Fill percentage adjusts based on sensor readings.**  
- If bin height **exceeds 20cm, fill percentage is set to 0.**  
- **Gradual increase** in waste percentage to prevent drastic fluctuations.
